üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get a local instance of Lumo up and running.

1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)

pnpm (recommended), yarn, or npm

Git

A MongoDB database instance (you can use a free MongoDB Atlas cluster).

2. Clone the Repository
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lumo.git
cd lumo

3. Install Dependencies

Using pnpm is recommended for managing dependencies efficiently.

Generated bash
pnpm install
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in the root of the project by copying the example file.

Generated bash
cp .env.example .env.local
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Now, open .env.local and fill in the required values.

Generated ini
# .env.local

# -----------------
# DATABASE
# -----------------
# Connection string for your MongoDB database.
# Used by both Mongoose and Prisma.
# Example for MongoDB Atlas: mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/lumo?retryWrites=true&w=majority
DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"

# -----------------
# AUTHENTICATION (NextAuth.js)
# -----------------
# A secret used to sign and encrypt session data.
# Generate one with: `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
# The canonical URL of your app. For local development, this is fine.
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Optional: Add OAuth provider credentials if you use them (e.g., Google, GitHub)
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"

# -----------------
# AI SERVICES (Google Gemini)
# -----------------
# Your API key for Google's Generative AI services.
# Get one from Google AI Studio: https://ai.google.dev/
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
5. Set Up the Database

Lumo uses both Mongoose and Prisma for database interactions.

Mongoose connects automatically using the DATABASE_URL. No extra steps are needed.

Prisma needs to generate its client based on your schema.

Run the following command to generate the Prisma Client, which provides type-safe database access:

Generated bash
npx prisma generate
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

To sync your Prisma schema with your database for the first time in development, use db push:

Generated bash
npx prisma db push
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Note: For production or more complex schema changes, you would typically use npx prisma migrate dev to create versioned migration files. db push is great for getting started quickly.

6. Run the Development Server

You're all set! Start the Next.js development server.

Generated bash
pnpm dev
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the Lumo platform in action.
